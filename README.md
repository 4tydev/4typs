The music industry right now is becoming really stressing. Being an takes time and patince, but of course its hard to keep composure and its difficult to accept the fact that everything is going to be OKAY. So I have some small 4typs to help you with your musical stress.


### Tip 1 ###


Don't be too hard on yourself: Sometimes the tracks we produce can come out as "awful." That's normal! Everyone makes mistakes, even major artists. We will never create the "perfect track," but it doesn't matter, just keep going.


### Tip 2 ###


Give yourself some space: Something I always do is go outside to the garden or the balcony to clear my head. Having a space to relax and letting your negative thoughts flow is truly healing. Find your space and tell yourself that you are a great artist!


### Tip 3 ###

Don't be afraid to ask for help: Seriously... everyone needs help! We can't do some things on our own. If you are great at music, but need help with marketing, then find a marketing that can help you grow! You don't have to do anything on your own. 


### Bonus Tip ###

It's not a tip, just a friendly message that I believe in your hard work! :)

Since October is Breast Cancer Prevention Month. I want to dedicate this 4typ to the most beautiful people in this universe: women! A lot of my followers are either female musicians or music lovers so I want to dedicate this 4typ to you!


## Typ 1 ##


Always explore yourself continously. Check for lumps and for any type of abnormality if needed! Always try to take care of yourself!


## Typ 2 ##


If you are over 30, take exams as regularly as possible! The sooner you get to check yourself, the better! It's better to get an experts opinion!


## Typ 3 ##


Eat healthy and drink or eat as much animal supplements as you can. For example vegetables, fruits, and milks made from soy, almond, etc.


## Bonus 4typ ##

Inform other women about the risk of breast cancer. Its always a good idea to talk about your problems to people who have the same fears as you! Always remember that you are strong!!!!!

"Take care" is not just a message, you have to take it seriously.
