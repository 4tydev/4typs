The music industry right now is becoming really stressing. Being an takes time and patince, but of course its hard to keep composure and its difficult to accept the fact that everything is going to be OKAY. So I have some small 4typs to help you with your musical stress.


### Tip 1 ###


Don't be too hard on yourself: Sometimes the tracks we produce can come out as "awful." That's normal! Everyone makes mistakes, even major artists. We will never create the "perfect track," but it doesn't matter, just keep going.


### Tip 2 ###


Give yourself some space: Something I always do is go outside to the garden or the balcony to clear my head. Having a space to relax and letting your negative thoughts flow is truly healing. Find your space and tell yourself that you are a great artist!


### Tip 3 ###

Don't be afraid to ask for help: Seriously... everyone needs help! We can't do some things on our own. If you are great at music, but need help with marketing, then find a marketing that can help you grow! You don't have to do anything on your own. 


### Bonus Tip ###

It's not a tip, just a friendly message that I believe in your hard work! :)
